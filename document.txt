Overview:
TechNova Electronics is focused on building smart automation systems for electronics assembly lines.
The company integrates AI-based vision inspection, predictive maintenance, and autonomous quality control.

AI Projects:
1. Vision Quality Inspector
   - Uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect visual defects in LED panels.
   - Accuracy: 97% on real production data.
   - Built using PyTorch and OpenCV.

2. Predictive Maintenance System
   - Collects temperature, vibration, and power data from robotic arms.
   - Uses a random forest model to predict potential failures before they happen.
   - Reduces downtime by 25%.

3. MES Data Integration
   - The Manufacturing Execution System (MES) records every product barcode during assembly.
   - Data is logged in a centralized MySQL database.
   - Each production line updates the system using Python scripts and barcode scanners.

Team Members:
- Jasman Jasman – AI Engineer, focuses on computer vision and system integration.
- Alice Lee – Data Scientist, develops predictive models and data dashboards.
- John Carter – Software Engineer, maintains MES connectivity and API interfaces.

Future Plan:
- Integrate LLM-based assistant for production line troubleshooting.
- Expand RAG system to access equipment manuals and error logs.
